# Global Air Pollution Data – AQI Analysis (Power BI)

## 📊 Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of global air pollution levels using Air Quality Index (AQI) data. It highlights pollution patterns across countries and cities based on key pollutants such as PM2.5, CO, NO2, and Ozone.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze overall AQI trends globally
- Compare air quality across countries and cities
- Identify pollution severity categories
- Study the impact of major pollutants (PM2.5, CO, NO2, Ozone)
- Highlight most and least polluted countries

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Power BI
- DAX
- Data Modeling
- Data Cleaning
- Data Visualization

## 📌 Key Insights
- PM2.5 is the most critical pollutant affecting AQI levels
- Majority of cities fall under Moderate AQI category
- Certain countries consistently show higher AQI values
- CO and NO2 levels remain relatively lower compared to PM2.5
- Significant variation exists between developed and developing countries
